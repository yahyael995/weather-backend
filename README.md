This is the backend server for my Full-Stack Weather Application. It is built with Node.js and Express, and it serves weather data fetched from the Open-Meteo API.

## ✨ Features

-   **Express Server:** A lightweight and robust Node.js framework.
-   **Live Weather Data:** Fetches real-time forecast data.
-   **CORS Enabled:** Securely handles requests from the frontend application.
-   **Dynamic API:** Accepts latitude and longitude to provide weather for any location.

## 🚀 Live URL

This backend is deployed on Render and is live at:
**[https://weather-backend-ogz2.onrender.com]** 
*(Replace this with your actual Render URL: https://weather-backend-xxxx.onrender.com )*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
-   **Express.js:** Web framework for Node.js.
-   **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the weather API.
-   **CORS:** To enable cross-origin requests.
